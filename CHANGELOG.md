# Version 1.1.1

- Fixed a bug where we didn't transpose a matrix back to its original orientation after applying the dct over the columns. This caused some images to get an invalid hash. This fix however will change all perceptual hashes generated by the perceptual hash function / hasher.

# Version 1.1.0

- Added workflow for pushing to main

# Version 1.0.0

- Added hashers for Average, Difference and Perceptual hashes
- Added utility functions for the hashers
- Added ImageHash object for encoding and decoding bit matricies
